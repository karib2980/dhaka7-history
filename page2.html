     <p>Khwaja Alimullah (died 24 August 1854) was the first Nawab of Dhaka. He was the founder of the Dhaka Nawab family.<sup>[2]</sup>

Alimullah was the nephew and heir of the merchant prince Khwaja Hafizullah, son of Khwaja Ahsanullah, and father of Khwaja Abdul Ghani, the first Nawab of Dhaka to be recognised by the British Raj<br><br><ins>BACKGROUND</ins><br>
<br>The ancestors of the Khwajas were said to have been traders of gold dust and leather in Kashmir. The earliest founder of the Dhaka Nawab Estate is Khwaja Hafizullah, who upheld the family tradition and made his fortune in trade and commerce. Leather and salt were the major items of his business. In collaboration with the European merchants in Dhaka, he developed a flourishing business in hides, skins, salt and spices.<br>
<br><ins>EARLY LIFE</ins><br>
<br>Hafizullah raised Alimullah, following the early death of Ahsanulla (his brother and Alimullah's father) in 1795, and groomed him as an estate manager.

Alimullah took major responsibilities in Hafizullah's business. The enterprising Alimullah acquired extensive land in and around Dhaka, as well as in Barisal District, Khulna District, Dhaka, Mymensingh and Tripura. He operated a moneylending business[2] and was a founder of The Dacca Bank (1846), the first European-style bank in Dhaka.[3] The bank is also notable for being the very first private bank started in the present day country of Bangladesh. He became one of the major shareholders and a director of the bank.[2] The bank was acquired by the Bank of Calcutta. The last few branches of the bank were shut in 1877 and were gradually replaced by the branches of the Bank of Calcutta.<sup>[4]</sup>

During this time, zamindari estates of defaulting proprietors were on sale everywhere in Bengal under the operation of Permanent Settlement. Hafizullah purchased estates and indigo factories in Barisal. Those purchases included Atia pargana in the then Mymensingh district (now in the Tangail district) and Aila Phuljhuri in the Bakarganj Sundarbans.

After Hafizullah's death, his estate descended on Alimullah, his sole heir. His acquisitions were added to those of his uncle, making the united zamindari one of the province's largest.<br></p>

<p>Nawab Bahadur Sir Khwaja Abdul Ghani KCSI (30 July 1813 – 24 August 1896) was the second Nawab of Dhaka and the first to assume the title of Nawab as hereditary, recognized by the British Raj.

He introduced the panchayat system, gaslights, water works, newspaper, and the zoological garden to Dhaka. He established Ahsan Manzil, the residence and seat of power for Dhaka Nawab Family, Victoria Park, the gardens at Dilkusha and Shahbag, where he initiated many annual events like Boli Khela and agricultural and industrial fair to celebrate the Christian New Year. He was also responsible for the Buckland Bund and the first female ward in the first hospital in Dhaka, and was a founding commissioner of Dhaka municipality.<br>
<br><ins>BACKGROUND</ins><br>
<br>Khwaja Abdul Ghani was the second son of Khwaja Alimullah, who consolidated the Khwaja family estate to become the first Nawab of the family. He was born into a wealthy and prominent Muslim family that traced its origins back to Persia.[1] He inherited the estate from his father, which included the French kuthi at Kumartuli bought by Alimullah in 1830, the Shahbag garden bought by Alimullah from Griffith Cook, a British Justice in 1840. His mother was Zinat Begum. Alimullah had 8 other wives and 15 other children.

Abdul Ghani was a polyglot; he spoke Bengali, Urdu, English, Arabic, and Persian. He had learnt Arabic and Persian at home, and English at Dhaka Collegiate School, where he was the student of the very first batch. He is known as patron of Urdu and Persian literature in Dhaka. He observed the Shi'a Remembrance of Muharram, and contributed to renovate Hoseni Dalan, the Shi'ite centre in Dhaka, though he was a Sunni himself. He also had close relations with the Hindu, Armenian and European communities.

In 1846, Khwaja Abdul Ghani inherited all the family properties, landed or otherwise, as an indivisible concern by a waqfnama executed by his father Khwaja Alimullah. As the mutawalli (trustee) he was made the sole administrator of the estate, as well as the sole representative and spokesperson of the family. He had the sole responsibility to distribute the family income as individual allowances and to select a successor as he deemed fit.

Abdul Ghani had four wives – Ismatunnesa Khanam, Umda Khanam, Munni Bibi, and Dulhan Bibi. His successor, Khwaja Ahsanullah, was his second son born to his first wife Ismatunnesa (d. 1887). He had 10 other children and 21 known grandchildren. Among his non-succeeding grandchildren the most famous was poet Khwaja Muhammad Afzal, son of his daughter Nurjahan Khanam and Nawab Khwaja Yusuf Jan Khan Bahadur.<br>
<br><ins>POLITICIAL VIEWS</ins><br>
<br>Abdul Ghani was loyal to the British Raj. During the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, he remained on their side and gave valuable information of the actual state of the country, and placed all his elephants, boats, horses, and carriages at their disposal. He said:[2]

My presence in the station at this critical moment inspires my countrymen with hope and confidence in the British Government and prevents the evil-doers from carrying out their wicked designs. My absence, on the other hand, will cause a general panic and precipitate matters which we are so anxious to prevent.

Abdul Ghani served the Raj long as member of the Municipality and the Magistracy, and was known as a fine arbiter of conflicts. In 1869, he settled a violent Shi'ite-Sunni riot through arbitration.

Abdul Ghani struck a good relation with Lord Northbrook, Governor General of India (1872–1876) who was against the Disraeli government in England, and Lord Dufferin, Viceroy of India (1884–1888) who enacted the Bengal Tenancy Act 1885. The Raj eventually vested the title of Nawab, which was made hereditary and was upgraded to the title of Nawab Bahadur.<br>

He also authored books in Persian and Urdu under the pen name of Shaheen. The palace Ahsan Manzil is named after him by his father Khwaja Abdul Ghani.[1]<br>
<br><ins>EARLY LIFE</ins><br>
<br>Ahsanullah was born in 1846 to Khwaja Abdul Ghani and Ismatun Nesa. As a young child he learned Urdu, Arabic and Persian in addition to the Islamic education of Quran, Hadith, and Fiqh.

<br><ins>AWARDS AND TITLES</ins><br>
<br>
Ahsanullah was awarded a Khan Bahadur in 1871, a Nawab in 1875, a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in 1891, a Nawab Bahadur in 1892, a Knight Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire (KCIE) in 1897, and a member of the Governor-General's Legislative Council in 1890 and again in 1899.[7]

<br><p>Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah Bahadur GCIE KCSI (7 June 1871 – 16 January 1915) was the fourth Nawab of Dhaka and one of the leading Muslim politicians during the British rule in India.[1]

On 30 December 1906, the All-India Muslim League was officially founded at the educational conference held in Dhaka.[2]

The convention was held at Ahsan Manzil, the official residence of the Dhaka Nawab Family. Sir Salimullah was a key patron of education for the Eastern Bengal. He was one of the founders of the University of Dhaka and the prestigious Ahsanullah School of Engineering (now the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology).[3][4][2]

Sir Salimullah was a staunch supporter of the Partition of Bengal and was a member of East Bengal and Assam Legislative Council from 1906 to 1907.[2][3]<br>
<br><ins>POLITICS</ins><br>
<br>Salimullah began his career in government service in 1893 as Deputy Magistrate, a position he held until he departed in 1895 to start his business in Mymensingh. In 1901 he inherited the position as the head of the Dhaka Nawab Family following his father's death.[2][5]

In 1903–04, Nawab Salimullah began supporting the partition of Bengal in the face of opposition of the Indian National Congress. On 16 October 1905, the day the Bengal Province was parted, Salimullah presided over a meeting of Muslim leaders from all over East Bengal in Northbrook Hall where a political front called Mohammedan Provincial Union was formed. With others of the front, Salimullah organized meetings around East Bengal in favor of the partition, while the Congress built up a movement to oppose it. On 14 and 15 April 1906, Salimullah organized and was named president at the first convention of East Bengal and Assam Provincial Educational Conference at Shahbag, Dhaka.

Later that year, newspapers published a dispatch from Salimullah to various Muslim leaders around India urging them to form an all-India political party he called Muslim All India Confederacy,[6] and leaders of the Aligarh Movement requested him to convene the 20th meeting of the All India Mohammedan Educational Conference at his own cost. Over two thousand people covering Muslim leaders from all over India gathered at the Nawab's family garden-house in Shahbag, Dhaka for the conference held between 27 and 30 December 1906. On the last day, the assembly formed the All India Muslim League, appointing Nawab Salimullah the Vice President and placing him on a committee to craft its constitution. Maulana Mohammad Ali Jauhar wrote the constitution of All-India Muslim League.[2][7]

Two years later, in December 1908, Salimullah would speak out for free speech in educational institutes and also rights for Muslims to separate elections.

Throughout these years, Salimullah held positions of authority in several leagues and conferences and continued to speak out on important political issues. In 1907, he became president of the All Bengal Muslim League, formed newly Kolkata.[2] In 1908, he became the secretary of the newly established East Bengal and Assam Provincial Muslim League, becoming president in 1909. He served as the chairman at the 22nd Convention of the All India Mohammedan Educational Conference at Amritsar in December 1908.[2] In 1909, he led people of wealth in the newly formed province to form the Imperial League of Eastern Bengal and Assam. In March 1911, at a meeting at the Ahsan Manzil, he presided over a decision to maintain the provincial Muslim League and provincial Educational Conference separate for political and educational activities. On 2 March 1912, Salimullah chaired a meeting at which the two Muslim Leagues of the Bengal were combined into the Presidency Muslim League and the two Muslim Associations were combined into the Bengal Presidency Muslim Association. Salimullah was made president of both the organisations.

In August 1911, Salimullah demanded a university for Dhaka at a function at a political function at Curzon Hall,[5] but it was not until after the shock of the annulment of the partition by George V on 12 December 1911 that Salimullah was able to achieve this goal. Within days of the annulment, Salimullah submitted a list of demands to Viceroy Lord Hardinge to protect the interest of Muslims. In response, a pledge was made to establish a university at Dhaka and to provide for Muslims an education officer, which pledge led to the inclusion of an Islamic Studies Department in Dhaka University. Salimullah continued afterwards to champion this cause, making speeches to counter those who argued against it and, in 1914, organizing a convention on 11–12 April for the Muslim Education Conference of United Bengal.

Along with his continued championing of education, Salimullah's last focuses before withdrawing from active politics in 1914 included situations involving Turkey. In 1912, he raised money from East Bengal to assist Turkish Muslims threatened by the Balkan wars. During World War I, however, he supported the Allied Powers after Turkey aligned with Germany.

<br><p>Nawab Khwaja Habibullah Bahadur; 26 April 1895 – 21 November 1958)[1] was a politician from East Bengal, soldier, social worker, and the fifth Nawab of Dhaka. He was the son of Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah Bahadur. Under Habibullah's rule, the Dhaka Nawab Estate went into decline until its actual relinquishment in 1952 by the East Pakistan Estates Acquisition Act.<br>
<br><ins>BIOGRAPHY</ins><br>
<br>Habibullah was born on 26 April 1895 in Dhaka.[2] His father was Nawab Sir Khwaja Salimullah Bahadur of the Dhaka Nawab family. The family traced its ancestry to Kashmiri merchants who settled in Bengal for trade during Mughal and British times.[3] Habibullah went to school at St. Paul's School in Darjeeling, and later continued his education in England.[2] In 1915, at the death of his father, he succeeded as the Nawab of Dhaka.[2]

In 1918, Habibullah joined the Bengali Platoon of the British Indian Army. He served in the British mandate of Mesopotamia as an honorary lieutenant.[2] He served in Dhaka district board and Dhaka municipality board. He took part in the Khilafat Movement.[2] He was the representative of Dhaka in the Bengal legislative council from 1924 till 1932.[2]

Habibullah had supported the 1932 Communal Award proposal of the British Raj. In 1935 he was the president of the Bengal Muslim League and member of the executive council of the All India Muslim league.[2] From 1937 to 1941 he was a minister in the cabinet of A. K. Fazlul Huq.[2] He joined the second cabinet of Haq against the wishes of the Muslim League for which he was suspended from the league till 1946. In 1946, he stood in the assembly election of Bengal as an independent candidate but suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of his relative, Khwaja Khairuddin who was on a Muslim League ticket.[2]

Habibullah presided over the committee that organized the Pakistan Independence Day celebrations in Dhaka, and, on 15 August 1947, raised the flag of Pakistan at Lalbagh Fort.[4] After the partition of India he held the position of vice-president in East Pakistan Muslim League.[2] During his reign as the Nawab of Dhaka, the estate continued the decline that had begun under his father.[5]<br>
<br><ins>PERSONAL LIFE AND DEATH</ins><br>
<br>Habibullah was married to Ajmiri Begum, Shahriar Khanam (d. 1931), Khurshidi Begum, Amirun Bibi and Ayesha Begum (d. 2008).[6]He had a total of five sons and two daughters.[6] Habibullah's cousin, Khwaja Nazimuddin, was the Prime Minister of Pakistan during 1951–1953.[7]

In later days, he retired from politics because of health related reasons. He left the Ahsan Manzil Palace and resided in another of the royal residences, Green House, in Dhaka's Paribagh. He died on 21 November 1958 and was buried alongside his father at the Nawab family graveyard in Begumbazar in Dhaka.[2]</p><br>
